# simpow: Simulation-based power analysis for basic linear mixed models

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this package is to provide helper functions for simple power analyses based on linear mixed models. (Support for generalized linear mixed models will be added in the future.)

## Installation

You can install the released version of simpow from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("aosmith16/simpow")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the current main function in **simpow** called `simpow_lmm_f`:

``` r
library(simpow)
## basic example code
```
