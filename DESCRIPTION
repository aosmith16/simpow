Description: The goal of this package is to enable the user to do simulation-based power analyses.
    Simulation functions uses provided information on "true" parameter values and study design details to simulate data
    based on a linear model, fit a model to the data, and extract p-values for overall tests of parameters. 
    Power is calculated as the percent of p-values below the chosen alpha cut-off. Currently only very basic linear mixed models are supported.
